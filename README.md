### Hello, I'm Francisco ðŸ‘‹

A software developer and a person who loves to share knowledge.

Here is a list of materials that I have used in my classes or just when I had to explain something.

- [UNIX/Linux Fundamentals](https://github.com/csce215)

I also have some guides regarding how to use different tools
