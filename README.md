### Hello, I'm Francisco ðŸ‘‹

A software developer and a person who loves to share knowledge.

Here is a list of materials that I have used in my classes or just when I had to explain something.

- [Platform Based Developments](https://franciscovilchezv.github.io/platform-based-development)
- [Introduction to Computer Science](https://github.com/intro-to-computer-science)

I also try to make guides for using different tools

- [Using `pass`](https://github.com/franciscovilchezv/coding-in-apple-silicon/tree/main/terminal/pass)

Thanks!
